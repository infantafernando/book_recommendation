Book Recommendation System
Overview
The Book Recommendation System is a collaborative filtering-based system designed to assist users in discovering new and relevant books based on their preferences and past interactions. Leveraging user ratings and book metadata, the system employs matrix factorization techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to generate personalized book recommendations. This README provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, functionalities, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

Features
Personalized Recommendations: The system provides personalized book recommendations tailored to individual user preferences and reading habits.

Matrix Factorization: Utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to factorize the user-item matrix and generate latent features for books and users.

Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets and accommodate growing user bases without compromising performance or accuracy.

Easy Integration: Can be easily integrated into existing applications or platforms, facilitating seamless deployment and integration with various systems.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and efficient Book Recommendation System capable of enhancing user experience and satisfaction in discovering new and relevant books. By leveraging collaborative filtering techniques and matrix factorization methods, the system aims to provide accurate and personalized recommendations tailored to individual user preferences. Through rigorous analysis and evaluation, the project seeks to demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and practical utility of the recommendation system in real-world scenarios.

Setup Instructions
To set up the Book Recommendation System on your local machine, follow these steps:
